# Crop-Prediction
A comparative analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms for crop prediction.
Performance of different machine learning algorithms like Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were measured using performance metrics which involves measuring the error values and accuracy.
Comparison of the predicted result of the different algorithm helps to determine which approach is more suitable. Performance of each model is evaluated based on the predicted accuracy.Â
